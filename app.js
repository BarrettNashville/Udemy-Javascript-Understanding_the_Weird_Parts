// Primitive Type: A type of data that represents a single value.
// Meaning... it's not an object. 

// There are 6 primitive types in JavaScript: 

// Undefined: represents a lack of existence. Don't use. This is what JS sets all variables to in the creation phase.

// Null: represents a lack of existence. You can set a variable to this. 

// Boolean: true or false. 

// Number: only one numeric type. It's a floating point number meaning there are always some decimals attached to it. This can make math weird. 

// String: a sequence of characters. Both '' and "" can be used to surround a string.

// Symbol: (new: used in ES6) We won't talk about this here.

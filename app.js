// explains the following using the console window
/*
var a = 3
undefined
var b = new Number(3)
undefined
a == b
true
//this coerces types
undefined
a === b
false
*/

// recommends moment.js which wraps up lots of functionality for dealing with dates; adding days etc. 

// this works because the "new" keyword isn't being used:
/*
var c = Number("3")
undefined
c
3
c === 3
true
*/

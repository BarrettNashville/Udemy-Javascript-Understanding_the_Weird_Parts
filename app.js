// We're going to build a library/framework called GREETR. 
// When given a first name, last name, and optional language, it generates formal and informal greetings. 
// We want to support English and Spanish languages. 
// We want an easy-to-type structure
// Should also support jQuery. Give it jQuery object and it will fill that object with the greeting.

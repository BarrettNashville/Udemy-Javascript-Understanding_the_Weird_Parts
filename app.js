// Transpile: convert the syntax of one programming language to another. 
// In this case, languages that don't really ever run anywhere, but instead are processed by 'transpilers' that generate javascript

// TypeScript, from Microsoft, is one example of a transpiler
// Traceur is another one. It lets you use ES6 even though its not released yet.
